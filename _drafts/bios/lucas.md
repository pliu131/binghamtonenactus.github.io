Hi, my name is Lucas Haas, CFO of Binghamton Enactus

I joined after seeing a GIM flyer one day, completely by chance, and saw how Enactus gives students a unique opportunity to put their ideas to practice. I was hooked from the first meeting onward, and knew I wanted a larger role after attending the Nationals competition.
